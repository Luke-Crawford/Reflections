Repository is where the files for that project are stored.  It creates a .git file, and allows for the user to start revising projects and committing them.

Staging Area:
The staging area is an inbetween are of working and repository.

Commit Szie:
You could add every change to the staging area, but only commit when there is a logical change in the code.  Or when the change works if you're having problems getting it to work.

When to Use Branches:
Branches would help when you are going to try out a new feature on your software.  It would help because it would allow you to keep your origianl working code, while trying out the new feature without changing it.
