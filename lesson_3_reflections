When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Using a remote repository would be a good idea when you are working with multiple people.  it would allow for you to eadily share files.
Also, it would be a good idea if you work on multiple computers, it would allow you to transfer the code easily, and would keep a backup online.
